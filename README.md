This folder contains the html and CSS files for Code Refactor homework.
Work I have done for this project is:

In index.html,
1. Modified the title of the website for user understanding.
2. Removed Non-Semantic elements like div from the code and added semantic elements like header, nav, section, article, aside, main, footer etc. 
3. Added "alt" attributes to all img Tag. 
4. Commented my changes in .html file.

In style.css,
1. Changed the CSS style sheet according to the use of semantic elements.
2. Commented my changes in .css file.
